A ViM plugin to send code to a pastebin such as paste.debian.net using XML-RPC

Use F2 in visual select mode to send it the selected text.
Use :PasteFile to send the whole file.
Use :PasteGajim to send the selected text and send the url to one of your gajim contact.


This is my first Vim plugin don't hesitate to send me comments about how I could make it better.
